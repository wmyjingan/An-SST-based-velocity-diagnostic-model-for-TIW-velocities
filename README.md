# An-SST-based-velocity-diagnostic-model-for-TIW-velocities
This is a code to calculate sea surface meridional velocities of tropical instability waves (TIWs) in Pacific Ocean from satellite SST for the period between 1981-2024. 
The input is satellite SST from NOAA OISSTv2 (3-day and 0.5deg latitude x 1deg longitude resolution), and two space-varying paramters: best-fit mean zonal flows and damping rates for SST variability.
The output is the surface meridional velcoties of TIWs.
